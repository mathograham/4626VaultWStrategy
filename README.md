# 4626VaultWStrategy

An autocompounding strategy applied to a vault meeting the EIP-4626 standard.

This is an update to my previous proof-of-concept repo for an auto-compounding strategy. This time, I am starting from
battle-tested vault code, and I am building my strategy on top. 

Please note this strategy and vault is a work in progress. I am presently testing in production on Auroraswap to work out bugs.
